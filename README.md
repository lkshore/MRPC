# Download and Process MRPC Dataset

The steps to download and process MRPC dataset.

1. Run `download_mrpc.zsh`
2. Run `process_mrpc.zsh`

The output of the processing is

1. `./MRPC/msr_paraphrase_test.txt`
2. `./MRPC/msr_paraphrase_train.txt`

Both files are less than 1MB in size, so these two files are
committed to github as well. The user does not need to run
the two steps above in order to use the MRPC dataset.
